# NewYorkTimesDemo
A demo application of New York Times. The application fetches top stories from New York Times API's and provides gist of information
to the user. The application is developed using Ionic Framework and Cordova. 

#Ionic Framework
Ionic is the open-source front end SDK for developing highly interactive HybridMobile Apps with Web Technologies. Ionic provides seed applications for 
the developers to get started with the application faster. The seed applications are of 3 types : blank, simple and side-menu. Thus the developers
get a headstart while developing a web application with ionic.
Also, Ionic provides excellent documentation so that the developers can leverage the advantages of ionic to full extent.

#Cordova
Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. 
These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing you to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or 
tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores. Cordova allows developers to write a single code for different platforms. 
A web app can be converted to run on any platform i.e Android, Windows, Blackberry, Apple.

#New York Times API
The New York Times allows developers to take advantages of different endpoints provided by them. The endpoint used in the application 
was of Top Stories API. The API returns all the current news accross the world with different categories as well. Thus, the developers can 
fetch the data of categories they want.
